# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bossardl

ðŸ’» I'm currently an AI Researcher at Fraunhofer, focusing on **Computer Vision**, **Signal Processing**, and **Digital Twins**.

ðŸŽ“ After completing my studies at the Engineering Institute Phelma (France), I was selected to further my education at **Georgia Tech** (Atlanta, GA, US), where I honed my skills in **AI** and **signal processing**.

ðŸ‘€ My research interests include:
- **Computer Vision**
- **State-of-the-art AI** (Graph Neural Networks & Geometric Neural Networks)
- **Signal Processing**

ðŸ“« You can reach me at:

- **LinkedIn**: [Ludovic Bossard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludovic-bossard-biomed/?locale=en_US)

ðŸ”§ **Check out some of my projects below:**

- **Biometric Identification** â€“ Tackling data imbalance through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Applied Math to AI** â€“ Predicting non-linear multivariate functions.
- **Computer Vision & AI for At-Home Physiotherapy** â€“ AI-driven solutions for remote healthcare.
- **1D-3D Conditional CycleGANs** â€“ Generating missing scan modalities for medical images.
- **Image Denoising and Enhancement** â€“ Processed 250GB of data and benchmarked against BM3D.

Feel free to explore the repositories and leave commentsâ€”there's always room for improvement!
